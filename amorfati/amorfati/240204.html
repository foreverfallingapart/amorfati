        <p>these words linger:<br>
            "why are you doing this?"<br>
            "i'll always see you as my baby"<br><br>

            day 2. it's hard. woke up today and things feel different. like im living in a different timeline. i wish the relationship was toxic. maybe then ending things would've been easier. <br><br>

            today i wondered if he hates me. i understand if he does. i want to ask him that so badly. i just hope that he understands why i did this one day. he sounds so cold in his text messages. it's painful and hard. i know he isn't the same. neither am i. i miss him so much. im so sorry justin. im so sorry for hurting you. im sorry for feeling this way. i dont know why i feel this way. why am i like this? i feel so sick in my stomach i want to throw up. <b>it's hard to look forward to the future when you were my entire future.</b> and now i have to start again, start from nothing. im so pitiful. i did this to myself, i did this to us. im undeserving of your love and i hurt you.<br><br>

            things i wanted to text you today:<br>
            goooood morning<br>
            are u okay?<br>
            i cant wait until the spy family movie comes out, i want to watch it together<br>
            are u eating well ?<br>
            pls try on the scrubs<br>
            btw, i never sent you my final portfolio, pls look at it<br>
            i miss you so much i cannot do my work. been taking lots of walks. i went to a candy store. the same one as the one we went to in irvine together. i bought konjac jelly and it was expired lol, just my luck. i saw the mint brand that tasted nasty. the lavendar mint. i just thought of how i miss exploring and trying new things with you. doing them alone is fine, i guess. but having a life to share with someone is so much more meaningful.<br>
            i just came home from the coffee shop and i feel like crying again.<br>
            i am crying again.
            <br><br>

            i'm listening to joji on repeat. i should not.<br><br>

            i liked me better when i was with you. the 920 days i spent with you were the first time in a decade where i did not feel depressed. im slumping back to that state and im scared. i should look to myself for happiness and contentment, but you were a ray of sunshine that made everything worth it.<br><br>

            i saw that you turned off your life360 location. is it selfish of me to want you to stay in my life as a friend? i saw that you posted on bereal today. i felt happy seeing your face.<br><br>

            i wonder if you'll keep our photos and memories of things we shared together. i hope you do. but knowing you, you will probably keep them in the beginning but once someone else comes along you will forget me. you will delete me. that's okay, i accept that.<br><br>

            i cherish the things you have gotten me. i wonder if you will send me a valentines gift like you promised.<br><br>

            i don't think i could ever forget about you and delete you. i could love, could learn to love, someone else in the future but i can never forget you nor not love you. you shaped me into who i am today. i will always be grateful for that. i will always be grateful for you.<br><br>
